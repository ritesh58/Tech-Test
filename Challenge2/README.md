Problem:
 We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within aws and provide a json formatted output. The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

Bonus Points

The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually

Solution:

   1. I am using bash and python scripts for this solution as per my skills
   2. This solution is also extended to allow for a perticular data key to be retrieved individually
   3. Script is asking for user input and prints the result as desired
   
Test:

    1. Run Command "./get_metadata.sh"
    2.  Enter 1 to fetch whole json
    3.  Enter 2 fetch perticular key value
