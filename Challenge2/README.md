Problem:
 We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within aws and provide a json formatted output. The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

Bonus Points

The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually

Solution:
    I am using shell and python scripts for this solution as per my skills
    This solution is also extended to allow for a perticular data key to be retrieved individually
    Script is asking for user input and prints the result as desired
Test:
    Run Command "./get_metadata.sh"
    Enter 1 to fetch whole json
    Enter 2 fetch perticular key value
cd ..
